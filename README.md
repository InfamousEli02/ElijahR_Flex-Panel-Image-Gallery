# ElijahR_Flex-Panel-Image-Gallery

This is Elijah Reed's Flex Panel Image Gallery project. For this project, we had to follow along with the WesBos Javascript30 course video before making modifications to our own galleries. This project utilized *querySelectorAll()* to select multiple "panel" elements in order to manipulate the toggles and styles of each one at the same time. I also utilized the *mouseover* and *mouseout* events to create a hover effect.
